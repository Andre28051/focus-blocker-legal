<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Focus Blocker</strong></p>
<small>Last updated: 2026-02-13</small>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>
By installing or using Focus Blocker, you agree to these Terms & Conditions.
If you do not agree, do not use the app.
</p>

<h2>2. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker is a productivity tool designed to help reduce distractions
by limiting access to selected apps during focus sessions.
</p>
<p>
The app is not a parental control solution, device management system,
security tool, or safety-critical application.
It must not be relied upon in emergency situations.
</p>

<h2>3. App Functionality Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker attempts to limit access to selected apps based on
your configuration and granted permissions.
</p>
<p>
Due to differences in Android versions, device manufacturers,
system updates, battery restrictions, and user settings,
blocking may not function continuously or perfectly in all cases.
</p>
<p>
The app is provided <em>“as is”</em>, without guarantees of uninterrupted
or error-free operation.
</p>

<h2>4. Permissions & System Settings</h2>
<p>
To provide its functionality, Focus Blocker may request:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Usage Access (Usage Stats)</strong> – to detect the currently active app.</li>
  <li><strong>Display over other apps (Overlay)</strong> – to show a blocking screen when a blocked app is opened.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If these permissions are denied, revoked, or restricted,
the app may not function correctly.
</p>
<p>
Some Android devices apply aggressive battery optimization
or background process restrictions that may prevent Focus Blocker
from running reliably.
</p>
<p>
For best performance, users may choose to disable battery optimization
for Focus Blocker in system settings.
However, this is optional and entirely at the user’s discretion.
</p>

<h2>5. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker may offer:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monthly subscription</li>
  <li>Yearly subscription</li>
  <li>Lifetime purchase (one-time payment)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pricing, billing terms, renewal conditions, and cancellation policies
are handled by the app store and shown at the time of purchase.
</p>
<p>
Subscriptions may renew automatically unless canceled
through the app store before the renewal date.
</p>
<p>
Lifetime access applies to the version and features
available at the time of purchase and does not guarantee
future feature additions or compatibility with all future devices.
</p>

<h2>6. User Responsibility</h2>
<p>
You are responsible for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>choosing which apps to block</li>
  <li>configuring schedules and focus sessions</li>
  <li>managing permissions and device settings</li>
  <li>understanding how blocking may affect notifications and app access</li>
</ul>
<p>
Uninstalling the app disables its functionality.
</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
To the maximum extent permitted by law,
the developer shall not be liable for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>lost productivity or missed deadlines</li>
  <li>missed calls, notifications, or messages</li>
  <li>device behavior caused by system restrictions or updates</li>
  <li>data loss or technical malfunctions</li>
  <li>any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages</li>
</ul>
<p>
Liability is limited to the amount paid for the app (if any).
</p>

<h2>8. Modifications</h2>
<p>
The app and these Terms may be updated at any time.
Continued use of the app after changes implies acceptance
of the updated Terms.
</p>
