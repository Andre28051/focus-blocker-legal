Last updated: 2025-12-28

##1. Introduction

Focus Blocker respects your privacy. This app is designed to work entirely on your device and does not collect, store, or share personal data.

##2. Data Collection

Focus Blocker does not collect any personal data.

No accounts

No analytics

No tracking

No advertising IDs

No third-party SDKs

All app data (settings, focus sessions) is stored locally on your device.

##3. Accessibility Service Usage

Focus Blocker uses the Android Accessibility Service solely to provide its core functionality: blocking selected apps during focus sessions.

Specifically, Accessibility is used to:

detect which app is currently in the foreground

prevent access to apps selected for blocking

The app:

does not record screen content

does not store UI data

does not transmit accessibility data

does not monitor user behavior beyond app blocking

Accessibility data is processed only in real time and never leaves the device.

##4. Data Sharing

Focus Blocker does not share data with third parties.
No data is transmitted to servers because no servers are used.

##5. Children’s Privacy

Focus Blocker does not knowingly collect data from children.
Because no personal data is collected, there is no risk of child data misuse.

##6. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes.
Any updates will be published at the same URL.
