<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Focus Blocker</strong></p>
<small>Last updated: 2025-12-28</small>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker respects your privacy. This app is designed to work entirely on your device
and does not collect, store, or share personal data.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not collect any personal data.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No accounts</li>
  <li>No analytics</li>
  <li>No tracking</li>
  <li>No advertising IDs</li>
  <li>No third-party SDKs</li>
</ul>
<p>
All app data (settings, focus sessions) is stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>3. Accessibility Service Usage</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker uses the Android Accessibility Service solely to provide its core functionality:
blocking selected apps during focus sessions.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Accessibility is used to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>detect which app is currently in the foreground</li>
  <li>prevent access to apps selected for blocking</li>
</ul>
<p>
The app:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>does not record screen content</li>
  <li>does not store UI data</li>
  <li>does not transmit accessibility data</li>
  <li>does not monitor user behavior beyond app blocking</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Accessibility Service is not used for advertising, analytics, or tracking purposes.
Accessibility data is processed only in real time and never leaves the device.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not share data with third parties.
No data is transmitted to servers because no servers are used.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not knowingly collect data from children.
Because no personal data is collected, there is no risk of child data misuse.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes.
Any updates will be published at the same URL.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
