<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Focus Blocker</strong></p>
<small>Last updated: 2026-02-11</small>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker is designed with privacy in mind. The app operates locally on your device
and does not collect, sell, or share personal data.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not require user accounts and does not collect personal information.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No analytics</li>
  <li>No tracking</li>
  <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
  <li>No third-party advertising SDKs</li>
</ul>
<p>
All app settings, schedules, and focus session data are stored locally on your device.
No user data is transmitted to external servers.
</p>

<h2>3. Usage Access Permission</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker uses the Android Usage Access permission (Usage Stats)
to detect which application is currently in the foreground.
</p>
<p>
This is required solely to determine whether a selected app should be blocked
during an active focus session.
</p>
<p>
The app:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>does not store detailed app usage history</li>
  <li>does not analyze user behavior</li>
  <li>does not transmit usage data</li>
  <li>processes usage information only in real time</li>
</ul>
<p>
All processing happens locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>4. Display Over Other Apps (Overlay Permission)</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker uses the “Display over other apps” (overlay) permission
to show a blocking screen above apps that are restricted during a focus session.
</p>
<p>
The overlay is used only to enforce blocking functionality.
It does not capture screen content, record interactions,
or monitor activity outside of blocking logic.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not share any data with third parties.
No personal data is transmitted because the app does not use remote servers.
</p>

<h2>6. Support Communication</h2>
<p>
If you voluntarily contact support (for example via email),
you may choose to provide diagnostic information to help resolve your issue.
</p>
<p>
This may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>App version</li>
  <li>Android version</li>
  <li>Device model</li>
  <li>Battery optimization status</li>
  <li>Premium or Free status</li>
  <li>Selected blocking mode (e.g. hard or soft blocking)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This information is used only to provide technical support
and is not used for analytics or marketing purposes.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Since no personal data is collected automatically,
there is no profiling or behavioral tracking.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes.
Any updates will be published at the same URL.
</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
