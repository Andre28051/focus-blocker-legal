<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Focus Blocker</strong></p>
<small>Last updated: 2026-02-11</small>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker is designed with privacy as a core principle.
The application operates entirely on your device and does not collect,
sell, or share personal data.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not require user accounts and does not automatically collect
any personal information.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No analytics</li>
  <li>No tracking</li>
  <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
  <li>No third-party advertising SDKs</li>
  <li>No remote servers</li>
</ul>
<p>
All app settings, schedules, blocked app lists, and focus session data
are stored locally on your device only.
</p>

<h2>3. Usage Access Permission</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker uses the Android Usage Access permission (Usage Stats)
solely to determine which application is currently active (in the foreground)
during an active focus session.
</p>
<p>
This permission is required exclusively to enforce app blocking functionality.
The app checks the currently active app in real time and compares it to
the user-defined blocked list.
</p>
<p>
Focus Blocker:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>does not store detailed usage history</li>
  <li>does not analyze behavioral patterns</li>
  <li>does not build user profiles</li>
  <li>does not transmit usage data</li>
  <li>does not access usage data outside of active blocking logic</li>
</ul>
<p>
All processing of usage information happens locally on the device
and only while focus blocking is active.
</p>

<h2>4. Display Over Other Apps (Overlay Permission)</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker uses the “Display over other apps” (overlay) permission
to show a blocking screen above applications that are restricted
during an active focus session.
</p>
<p>
The overlay is used strictly to display the blocking interface.
The app does not capture screen content, record interactions,
log screen data, or monitor activity beyond blocking enforcement.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not share data with third parties.
No personal data is transmitted because the application does not use
external servers or cloud storage.
</p>

<h2>6. Support Communication</h2>
<p>
If you voluntarily contact support (for example via email),
you may choose to provide diagnostic information to help resolve your issue.
</p>
<p>
Such information may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>App version</li>
  <li>Android version</li>
  <li>Device model</li>
  <li>Battery optimization status</li>
  <li>Premium or Free status</li>
  <li>Selected blocking mode (e.g., hard or soft blocking)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This information is not collected automatically.
It is only received if you voluntarily provide it when requesting support.
The information is used exclusively for troubleshooting purposes
and is not used for analytics, marketing, or profiling.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
Focus Blocker does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Because the app does not collect personal data,
there is no behavioral tracking or profiling.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the app’s functionality changes.
Any updates will be published at the same URL.
</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
